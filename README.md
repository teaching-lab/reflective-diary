Teacher's Reflective Diary
==========================

This diary will help you reflect your own teaching. It suggests things to pay attention to, questions to ask and aspects to ponder. But bear in mind -- it's not a cookbook for good teaching, it is only a guidebook for your own journey.

To supplement your teaching reflection, join the conversation with your fellow teachers. Ask around at your institution for a teaching and learning center or directly engage your colleagues teaching the same course.

If you are from Masaryk University (Czech Republic), you can enroll in the [*Teaching Lab course*](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/DUCIT) at the [Faculty of Informatics MUNI](https://fi.muni.cz) to learn more and join the discussion on better teaching.

The compiled version is available at GitHub (see the ['*releases*' tab](https://github.com/mukrop/teachers-reflective-diary/releases)). There are two language versions (Czech and English), each in a reading variant and two print variants. The diary is typeset in LaTeX. The included *Makefile* facilitates the compilation process on Linux-based systems.

## How to use the reflective diary?

First and foremost, use it regularly.

Note down your thoughts both when planning the lesson and after delivering it. There are thirteen spreads (one for each semester week), each suggesting a handful of questions. The diary is quite small -- it's partly to keep your notes short.

After the spreads for individual weeks, there is a teacher evaluation rubric, a list of indicators that can be evaluated, a list of some useful teaching tools, and some extra space for your notes and remarks.
